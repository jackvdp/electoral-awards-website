– Message under event header, saying sign in or sign up if they are not/message event has passed
– Bug: Users are seemingly able to sign up via magic link
– Ability to export users signed up to event as a CSV
– when event or user is edited or deleted it should refresh the dashboard
– Automated emails for event signup
